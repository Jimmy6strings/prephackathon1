<main class="history">
I was born in West Texas on May 12, 1985 in a small town called Midland. I grew up in and around east Texas, moving from Austin, Houston, a stretch in Dallas, and eventually landing in Kansas City where I would spend my high school years. After high school, I attended the University of North Texas where I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy and Religious Studies.
